# Home-Lab-Project-Building-a-Multi-Hommed-Router-and-Firewall-with-Debian
This project simulates a real-world network environment. We configured a Debian server as a router and firewall for a Windows Server and a Kali Linux machine. We used iptables for IP forwarding and NAT to allow Internet access. The final goal is to send logs to Splunk for event analysis.
